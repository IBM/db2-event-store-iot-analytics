# Analyze IoT sensor data with machine learning and advanced analytics

This code pattern demonstrates the use of Jupyter notebooks to interact with IBM Db2 Event Store -- from the creation of database objects to advanced analytics and machine learning model development and deployment.

The sample data used in this code pattern simulates data collected by real industry IoT sensors. The IoT sample data includes sensor temperature, ambient temperature, power consumption, and timestamp for a group of sensors identified with unique sensor IDs and device IDs.
A simple IBM Streams flow is used to stream the sample data from a CSV file to an Event Store table.

Db2 Event Store is an in-memory database designed for massive structured data volumes and real-time analytics, built on Apache Spark and Apache Parquet Data Format. The solution is optimized for event-driven data processing and analysis. It can support emerging applications that are driven by events such as IoT solutions, payments, logistics and web commerce. It is flexible, scalable and can adapt quickly to your changing business needs over time. Db2 Event Store is available in a free developer edition and an enterprise edition that you can download now. The enterprise edition is free for pre-production and test, please visit the [official product webpage](https://www.ibm.com/products/db2-event-store) for more information.

> Note: Db2 Event Store is built with IBM Watson Studio

### 5. Query the table

Follow the same process to add and run a notebook. This time choose the file named **`Event_Store_Querying.ipynb`**.

This notebook demonstrates best practices for querying the data stored in the IBM Db2 Event Store database. Verify that you have successfully created and loaded the table before continuing.

### 6. Analyze the data

Next, run the data analytics notebook. Use the file **`Event_Store_Data_Analytics.ipynb`**.

This notebook shows how the IBM Db2 Event Store can be integrated with multiple popular scientific tools to perform various data analytics tasks. As you walk through the notebook, you'll explore the data to filter it and example the correlation and covariance of the measurements. You'll also use some charts to visualize the data.

#### Probability plots, box plots, and histograms for temperature data

![plots](doc/source/images/plots.png)

#### Scatter plots to show the relationship between measurements

![scatters](doc/source/images/scatters.png)

### 7. Create and deploy a machine learning model

This section demonstrates building and deploying a machine learning model. The notebook uses Spark MLlib to build and test a prediction model from our IoT temperature sensor data. At the end, it demonstrates how to deploy and use the model.

If you are using the **Enterprise Edition** of Db2 Event Store, the notebook will deploy the model using Db2 Event Store which is built with Watson Studio Local.

If you are using the **Developer Edition** of Db2 Event Store, you need an IBM Cloud Watson Machine Learning service instance to complete the deployment. Follow these steps:

* Sign in and create the service [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/machine-learning).
* Click on `Service credentials` and then `New credential` and `Add`.
* Use `View credentials` and copy the credentials JSON.
* You will use the JSON to set the `wml_credentials` variable in the notebook.
* The notebook will pip install watson-machine-learning-client. After the install, you usually need to restart your kernel and run the notebook again from the top.

Load the notebook, using the file **`Event_Store_ML_Model_Deployment.ipynb`**.

Once the model is built and deployed, you can easily send it a new measurement and get a predicted temperature (one at a time or in batches).

#### Given a new data point

```python
new_data = {"deviceID" : 2, "sensorID": 24, "ts": 1541430459386, "ambient_temp": 30, "power": 10}
```

#### The result includes a predicted temperature

```python
predictions:  [48.98055760884435]
```
